# CS-2450-User-Interface-Design-Programming
This repository stores an assignment and a project I worked on in CS 2450 - User Interface Design and Programming
I took this course at California State Polytechnic University, Pomona

In the assignment, there are two tasks. One was to create a tip calculator and a die simulator using JavaFX.

The project was done in a group and it was to re-create a  portion of a previous website/application. We decided to re-create a website one of our group members owns, [cppscheduler](https://cppscheduler.com/scheduleBuilder). The project also used JavaFX as well as CSS.

## Things I learned in this course
- User interfaces
- Interaction design and development process
- Usability of interactive systems
- Graphical User Interface programming
- Event-handling
- User evaluation methods
